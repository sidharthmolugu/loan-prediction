# loan-prediction
It is a classification problem where we have to predict whether a loan would be approved or not. In these kinds of problems, we have to predict discrete values based on a given set of independent variable( s).
Generally, loan prediction involves the lender looking at various background information about the applicant and deciding whether the bank should grant the loan. Parameters like credit score, loan amount, lifestyle, career, and assets are the deciding factors in getting the loan approved. If, in the past, people with parameters similar to yours have paid their dues timely, it is more likely that your loan would be granted as well.
Machine learning algorithms can exploit this dependency on past experiences and comparisons with other applicants and formulate a data science problem to predict the loan status of a new applicant using similar rules.
Several collections of data from past loan applicants use different features to decide the loan status. A machine learning model can look at this data, which could be static or time-series, and give a probability estimate of whether this loan will be approved. Let's look at some of these datasets.
